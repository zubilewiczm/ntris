nTris -- a clone of Tetris with a twist.

1) The rules

  Move and rotate falling blocks to fill out the well by arranging them in
  horizontal lines without any holes. Every such line will be erased, granting
  you a few points and making more room to maneuver. If blocks fill the stage
  entirely, they'll prevent another block from appearing, ending the game. Your
  goal is to survive for as long as you can and earn as much points as
  possible!
  
  You probably ask yourself: where's the twist then? It's a surprise! You'll
  know when you gather more than 1500 points in one go!
  
2) Controls

  A   : move left
  S   : move down
  D   : move right
  V   : rotate counterclockwise
  B   : rotate clockwise
  P   : pause
  ESC : exit game
