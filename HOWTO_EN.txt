nTris -- a clone of Tetris with a twist.

1) The rules

  Move and rotate falling blocks to fill the game area in a way, to arrange
  them in horizontal lines without any holes. Every such line will be erased,
  granting you a few points and making more room to maneuver. If blocks fill
  the stage entirely, they'll prevent another block from
  appearing -- is that case the game ends. Your goal is to survive as
  long as you can and earn as much points as possible!
  
  You probably ask yourself: where's the twist then? It's a surprise -- you'll
  know when you gather more than 5000 points in one go!
  
2) Controls

  A   : move left
  S   : move down
  D   : move right
  V   : rotate counterclockwise
  B   : rotate clockwise
  P   : pause
  ESC : exit game
